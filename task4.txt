Q4. Briefly explain what GitHub is and how it facilitates collaboration and version control also name some alternatives to GitHub.

Solution: GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It allows individuals and teams to store, manage,
and collaborate on code and other project files. Here's how GitHub facilitates collaboration and version control:

1. Version Control: GitHub is built around Git, which is a powerful version control system. It allows developers to track changes, manage 
different versions of a project, and collaborate seamlessly.

2. Remote Repository Hosting: GitHub serves as a remote repository for projects. This means that you can store your Git repositories on 
GitHub's servers, making it easy to share your code with others and access it from different locations or devices.

3. Collaborative Workflows: GitHub provides features like pull requests, issues, and project boards, which facilitate collaboration among 
team members. Pull requests allow for code reviews, discussions, and the integration of changes. Issues help track tasks, enhancements, 
and bugs. Project boards provide a visual way to organize and manage tasks.

4. Code Review and Collaboration Tools: GitHub offers features for code reviews, including comments on specific lines of code, 
discussions, and the ability to suggest changes. This encourages best practices, quality code, and knowledge sharing among team members.

5. Community and Open Source Contributions: GitHub is a hub for open-source projects, making it easy for developers from around the world 
to contribute to a wide range of projects. It provides features like forking, pull requests, and issue tracking to facilitate open-source 
collaboration.

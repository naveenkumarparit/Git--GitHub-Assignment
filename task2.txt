Q2. Explain the Git Workflow, including the staging area, working directory, and repository.

Solution:- The Git workflow is a set of steps and stages that developers follow to manage and track changes effectively using Git. It involves three main components: the working directory, the staging area (also known as the index), and the repository. Let me explain each of them:

1. Working Directory:
    The working directory is the directory on your computer where you create, edit, and modify your files. It's essentially the folder where you're actively working on your project.

2. Staging Area (Index):
    The staging area is like a middle ground between your working directory and the repository. It's a place where you can gather and prepare changes before you commit them to the repository.
    When you have made changes in your working directory, you use the `git add` command to stage those changes. This means you are telling Git to include these changes in the next commit.
    The staging area allows you to selectively choose which changes to include in a commit. This gives you control over what gets saved in your repository.

3. Repository:
    The repository (or repo) is where Git permanently stores the history of your project. It's typically located in a hidden directory called .git at the root of your project.
    When you make a commit, Git takes a snapshot of the files that are staged in the staging area and stores a reference to that snapshot in the repository along with some metadata (like the author, timestamp, etc.).
    This repository contains all the committed versions of your project, allowing you to revert to earlier states if needed.

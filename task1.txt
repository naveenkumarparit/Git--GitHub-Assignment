Q1. Explain what version control is and its importance in software development.

Solution:- Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to track and manage 
different versions of a project.In software development, version control is crucial for managing code and 
collaborating with other developers effectively.

Importance of version control in web development:
1. History Tracking: Version control systems (VCS) keep a detailed history of every change made to a project. This
includes who made the change, when it was made, and what specific changes were implemented. This historical records
is invaluable for for understanding the evolution of a project and for troubleshooting

2. Collaboration: In a collaborative development environment, multiple developers may work on the same project
simultaneously. Without version control, coordinating these efforts can be extremely challenging and error-prone. 

3. Conflict Resolution: When multiple people are working on the same files, conflicts can arise. Version control 
systems provide tools to manage and resolve conflicts, ensuring that changes don't overwrite or interfere with each
other.

4. Branching and Merging: VCS enables developers to create separate branches of the codebase. Each branch can be 
used for different features, bug fixes, or experiments. Once a branch's work is complete and tested, it can be 
merged back into the main codebase. 

5. Revert to Previous States: Sometimes, a change may introduce a bug or unintended behavior. With version control,
it's possible to roll back to a previous, stable state of the project, effectively undoing any problematic changes.

6. Scalability: Version control systems are designed to handle large and complex projects with many contributors. 
They are capable of managing thousands or even millions of files and their associated history.
